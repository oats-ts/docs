# Generate

The generator step is responsible for taking the validated output of the [reader](OpenAPI-Reader), and turning it into an intermediate representation (Typescript [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) in this case), that can be then turned into source code. The OpenAPI generator itself doesn't do much, the work is distributed to single responsiblity generators, that are responsible for generating one thing (like types from the JSON schemas, or serializers for parameters). They also provide means for other generators to access references to their generated content.

The generators that comes with oats by default can be accessed from the [@oats-ts/openapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oats-ts/openapi), but it originates from the [@oats-ts/openapi-generators](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oats-ts/openapi-generators) package.

## Examples

### Using individual generators

You can configure your generator from a set of code generators of your choosing. For this approach, it's the easiest to use `generators.create` from the [@oats-ts/openapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oats-ts/openapi) package. You can use the generator names (see below) as the first argument, and optionally the approriate configuration object as the second argument (autocomplete will help with this).

```ts
import { generator, nameProviders, pathProviders, generators } from '@oats-ts/openapi'

const withGenerators = generator({
  nameProvider: nameProviders.default(),
  pathProvider: pathProviders.default('src/generated'),
  children: [
    generators.create('oats/type', { documentation: false }),
    generators.create('oats/type-guard'),
    generators.create('oats/type-validator'),
  ],
})
```

### Using presets

You can also use presets (I'd recommend starting with presets). Presets are a set of generators grouped toghether. The ones available currently are `presets.client()`, `presets.server()` and `presets.fullStack()`. The simplest way is to use the preset without any configuration:

```ts
import { generator, nameProviders, pathProviders, presets } from '@oats-ts/openapi'

const withDefaults = generator({
  nameProvider: nameProviders.default(),
  pathProvider: pathProviders.default('src/generated'),
  children: presets.client(),
})
```

Presets offer configuration options, that affect possibly multiple individual generators. In this case we are disabling the documentation for all the generators that support this option:

```ts
const withOverrides = generator({
  nameProvider: nameProviders.default(),
  pathProvider: pathProviders.default('src/generated'),
  children: presets.client({
    documentation: false,
    validateResponses: false,
  }),
})
```

In case you want to really fine tune presets, you can override the configuration for individual generators as well. In this case we are only generating documentation for types:

```ts
const withOverrides = generator({
  nameProvider: nameProviders.default(),
  pathProvider: pathProviders.default('src/generated'),
  children: presets.client({ documentation: false }).override({ 'oats/type': { documentation: true } }),
})
```

### Mixing presets and generators

Presets and individual generators can be used together:

```ts
const withPresetsAndGenerators = generator({
  nameProvider: nameProviders.default(),
  pathProvider: pathProviders.default('src/generated'),
  children: [presets.client(), generators.create('oats/express-cors-router-factory')],
})
```

## Configuration

The main `generator` function can be configured with an object having the following properties:

- `nameProvider: (input: any, originalName: string | undefined, target: string) => string` - A function that determines how each generated artifact is called. For reasonable, convention respecting names use `nameProviders.default()`
  - `input` is the part of the OpenAPI object tree that the given artifact is based on (eg.: A Schema object or Operation object).
  - `originalName` optionally appears for pieces of the OpenAPI document, where the name is not part of the object itself (eg.: Schema object).
  - `target` is one of the names listed below.
- `pathProvider: (input: any, name: NameProvider, target: string) => string` - A function that determines where in the disk each artifact is written to (`SourceFile#fileName`). Check `pathProviders.*` for options.
  - `input` is the part of the OpenAPI object tree that the given artifact is based on (eg.: A Schema object or Operation object).
  - `name` is a simplified function that takes the `input` and the `target` and delegates to the `nameProvider`.
  - `target` is one of the names listed below.
- `children: OpenAPIGenerator | OpenAPIGenerator[]` - A single generator or a list of generators. See available ones below.
- `noEmit?: boolean = false` - When `true`, the generators return no output `SourceFile`s.
- `name?: string = 'root'` - The name of the root generator, shows up in logs.

## Available generators

There are a number of code generators available. These are part of certain presets, but can also be used individually, using `generators.create`. In case you want to see them in action, check the [demo](#/demo) page!
