# Using a generated server

In this guide you'll learn how to use the server side pieces generated by Oats. If you followed the ["Getting started"](OpenAPI_GettingStarted) guide, now you sould have a `generated` folder in `src`, that contains a bunch of subfolders, and some generated code in them. The most important folder for us is `src/generated/api`, where you'll find a file called `BookStoreApi.ts`.

## The API type

This is how the `BookStoreApi` type looks like (imports and JSDoc comments ommited):

```typescript
export type BookStoreApi = {
  getBooks(request: GetBooksServerRequest): Promise<GetBooksServerResponse>
  addBook(request: AddBookServerRequest): Promise<AddBookServerResponse>
  getBook(request: GetBookServerRequest): Promise<GetBookServerResponse>
}
```

If you have checked out the [SDK guide](OpenAPI_GeneratedSdk), it may look familiar and that is no accident. But in this case, you have to provide an implementation for this API type yourself.

## Implementing the API

In this example we are going to use a class implementation, as it lends itself for our purpose.

```typescript

```
