# SDK usage

In this guide you'll learn the basic usage of the generated SDK.

To start using the SDK, you will need an implementation of the previously described SDK type. Oats generates an SDK implementation class (`BookStoreSdkImpl` in our case), that you can find next to the SDK type (in `src/generated/sdk`).

To instantiate this class, we'll need an input parameter called `adapter` of type `ClientAdapter`. This adapter is responsible for bridiging the generated code with a request library. Oats ships with a single client adapter based on the [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) API, but you can roll your own, by either extending the default `FetchClientAdapter`, or simply implementing the `ClientAdapter` type.

```typescript
import { FetchClientAdapter } from '@oats-ts/openapi-fetch-client-adapter'
import { BookStoreSdkImpl } from './generated/sdk/BookStoreSdkImpl'

// Instantiate adapter with a base URL, where your spec compliant server is running
const adapter = new FetchClientAdapter({ url: 'http://localhost:3000' })
// Instantiate the SDK with the adapter
const sdk = new BookStoreSdkImpl(adapter)
```

Once you have your SDK instance, you can use it plain and simple, as you would expect. Below are a few simple examples of using the different operations on the generated SDK.

### addBook

This operation uses a request body, with JSON mime type.

```typescript
// Create a new Book
const response = await sdk.addBook({
  mimeType: 'application/json',
  body: { id: -1, author: 'BalÃ¡zs', title: 'Test book', price: 10 },
})
// If the statusCode is 201, we know the request was a success
if (response.statusCode === 201) {
  // We (and the compiler) also know the body will be of Book type
  const book = response.body
  console.log('You created this book', book)
} else {
  // We (and the compiler) know the body is of AppError[] type
  // Error types are also user defined like all other types
  response.body.forEach((err) => console.log(err.message))
}
```

### getBook

This operation uses a path parameter.

```typescript
const response = await sdk.getBook({ path: { bookId: 1 } })
if (response.statusCode === 200) {
  const book = response.body
  console.log('This is your book', book)
} else {
  response.body.forEach((err) => console.log(err.message))
}
```

### getBooks

This operation uses a mix of query and header parameters.

```typescript
const response = await sdk.getBooks({
  query: { offset: 1 },
  headers: { 'x-limit': 3 },
})
if (response.statusCode === 200) {
  const books = response.body
  books.forEach((book) => console.log(book))
} else {
  response.body.forEach((err) => console.log(err.message))
}
```
