# Prepare your OpenAPI document

Next, you need an OpenAPI document describing your API. In case you don't have one already, try this example:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oats-ts/oats-schemas/master/schemas/book-store.json
```

All guides are using the above example, so it's a good place to start.
