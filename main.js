In this article I'm listing the most common \"mistakes\" that you can make, that doesn't make your OpenAPI document invalid, but effectively prevents tooling from outputing usable documentation or code.\n\n## TODO"},88213:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>r});const r="# Custom Generators\n\nDocumentation is in progress.\n"},35625:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>r});const r="# Generate\n\nThe generator step is responsible for taking the validated output of the [reader](OpenAPI-Reader), and turning it into an intermediate representation (Typescript [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) in this case), that can be then turned into source code. The OpenAPI generator itself doesn't do much, the work is distributed to single responsiblity generators, that are responsible for generating one thing (like types from the JSON schemas, or serializers for parameters). They also provide means for other generators to access references to their generated content.\n\nThe generators that comes with oats by default can be accessed from the [@oats-ts/openapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oats-ts/openapi), but it originates from the [@oats-ts/openapi-generators](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oats-ts/openapi-generators) package.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Using individual generators\n\nYou can configure your generator from a set of code generators of your choosing. For this approach, it's the easiest to use `generators.create` from the [@oats-ts/openapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oats-ts/openapi) package. You can use the generator names (see below) as the first argument, and optionally the approriate configuration object as the second argument (autocomplete will help with this).\n\n```ts\nimport { generator, nameProviders, pathProviders, generators } from '@oats-ts/openapi'\n\nconst withGenerators = generator({\n  nameProvider: nameProviders.default(),\n  pathProvider: pathProviders.default('src/generated'),\n  children: [\n    generators.create('oats/type', { documentation: false }),\n    generators.create('oats/type-guard'),\n    generators.create('oats/type-validator'),\n  ],\n})\n```\n\n### Using presets\n\nYou can also use presets (I'd recommend starting with presets). Presets are a set of generators grouped toghether. The ones available currently are `presets.client()`, `presets.server()` and `presets.fullStack()`. The simplest way is to use the preset without any configuration:\n\n```ts\nimport { generator, nameProviders, pathProviders, presets } from '@oats-ts/openapi'\n\nconst withDefaults = generator({\n  nameProvider: nameProviders.default(),\n  pathProvider: pathProviders.default('src/generated'),\n  children: presets.client(),\n})\n```\n\nPresets offer configuration options, that affect possibly multiple individual generators. In this case we are disabling the documentation for all the generators that support this option:\n\n```ts\nconst withOverrides = generator({\n  nameProvider: nameProviders.default(),\n  pathProvider: pathProviders.default('src/generated'),\n  children: presets.client({\n    documentation: false,\n    validateResponses: false,\n  }),\n})\n```\n\nIn case you want to really fine tune presets, you can override the configuration for individual generators as well. In this case we are only generating documentation for types:\n\n```ts\nconst withOverrides = generator({\n  nameProvider: nameProviders.default(),\n  pathProvider: pathProviders.default('src/generated'),\n  children: presets.client({ documentation: false }).override({ 'oats/type': { documentation: true } }),\n})\n```\n\n### Mixing presets and generators\n\nPresets and individual generators can be used together:\n\n```ts\nconst withPresetsAndGenerators = generator({\n  nameProvider: nameProviders.default(),\n  pathProvider: pathProviders.default('src/generated'),\n  children: [presets.client(), generators.create('oats/express-cors-router-factory')],\n})\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe main `generator` function can be configured with an object having the following properties:\n\n- `nameProvider: (input: any, originalName: string | undefined, target: string) => string` - A function that determines how each generated artifact is called. For reasonable, convention respecting names use `nameProviders.default()`\n  - `input` is the part of the OpenAPI object tree that the given artifact is based on (eg.: A Schema object or Operation object).\n  - `originalName` optionally appears for pieces of the OpenAPI document, where the name is not part of the object itself (eg.: Schema object).\n  - `target` is one of the names listed below.\n- `pathProvider: (input: any, name: NameProvider, target: string) => string` - A function that determines where in the disk each artifact is written to (`SourceFile#fileName`). Check `pathProviders.*` for options.\n  - `input` is the part of the OpenAPI object tree that the given artifact is based on (eg.: A Schema object or Operation object).\n  - `name` is a simplified function that takes the `input` and the `target` and delegates to the `nameProvider`.\n  - `target` is one of the names listed below.\n- `children: OpenAPIGenerator | OpenAPIGenerator[]` - A single generator or a list of generators. See available ones below.\n- `noEmit?: boolean = false` - When `true`, the generators return no output `SourceFile`s.\n- `name?: string = 'root'` - The name of the root generator, shows up in logs.\n\n## Available generators\n\nThere are a number of code generators available. These are part of certain presets, but can also be used individually, using `generators.create`.

In these guides I'm going to use the [book store](https://github.com/oats-ts/oats-schemas/blob/master/schemas/book-store.json) example:\n\n```text\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/oats-ts/oats-schemas/master/schemas/book-store.json\n```\n\n## Install Oats generator modules\n\nTo get generating, you'll need the main Oats module. This simply contains all that you need to generate, but you won't need anything from this module, when using the generated code:\n\n```text\nnpm i --dev @oats-ts/openapi\n```\n\n## Configure Oats\n\nOats borrows its configuration philosophy from Webpack, meaning code is configuration. Let's create a file called `oats.js` (you can call it whatever you want), and add a basic Oats configuration:\n\n```javascript\nconst oats = require('@oats-ts/openapi')\n\noats.generate({\n  logger: oats.loggers.simple(),\n  reader: oats.readers.https.json(\n    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oats-ts/oats-schemas/master/schemas/book-store.json',\n  ),\n  validator: oats.validator(),\n  generator: oats.generator({\n    nameProvider: oats.nameProviders.default(),\n    pathProvider: oats.pathProviders.default('src/generated'),\n    // Use presets.client() or presets.server() for just client/server side code\n    children: oats.presets.fullStack(),\n  }),\n  writer: oats.writers.typescript.file({\n    format: oats.formatters.prettier({\n      parser: 'typescript',\n    }),\n  }),\n})\n```\n\nEach part of this code can be customized or even fully replaced. The main components are:\n\n- `generate` - The main generator harness function\n- `reader` - Reads the input, resolves it's dependencies, and structuraly validates it\n- `validator` - Semantically validates the resolved document\n- `generator` - Runs a set of code generators, either as a list of individual generators, or presets\n- `writer` - Writes the generator output to the disk\n- `logger` - Event-driven logger that logs important generator events\n\n## Run Oats\n\nNow that we have the generator set up, you can run it like any node.js script:\n\n```text\nnode ./oats.js\n```\n\n**NOTE:** In this example we are using Javascript for configuring and running the generator, even though the project is built in and for Typescript. In case you want to define your configuration in Typescript, you can, but you'll need to solve running it, for which the simplest solution is [`ts-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node). However in a decent IDE (like VSCode) you will still have good content assist in Javascript, when putting together this configuration, because of the type definitions exposed by the Oats packages.\n\n## Verify results\n\nIn case Oats successfully ran, you will see something like this in the terminal:\n\n```text\n✔ reader step completed using \"@oats-ts/openapi-reader\"\n✔ validator step completed using \"@oats-ts/openapi-validator\"\n✔ generator step completed using \"@oats-ts/openapi-generators\"\ni some outputs have runtime dependencies:\n  npm i \\\n    @oats-ts/openapi-express-server-adapter@0.0.43 \\\n    @oats-ts/openapi-fetch-client-adapter@0.0.43 \\\n    @oats-ts/openapi-runtime@0.0.43 \\\n    express@^4.18.1\n✔ writer step completed using \"@oats-ts/typescript-writer\"\n```\n\nSome generated outputs might have runtime dependencies (eg.: you generated `express` routers, therefore the generated code has a runtime depdency on `express`). These dependencies are summarized as a convenient `npm install` command after the generator step completes (on line `5` in this example).\n\nGrab this command, and run it:\n\n```text\nnpm i \\\n  @oats-ts/openapi-express-server-adapter@0.0.43 \\\n  @oats-ts/openapi-fetch-client-adapter@0.0.43 \\\n  @oats-ts/openapi-runtime@0.0.43 \\\n  express@^4.18.1\n```\n\n## Using the generated code\n\nDepending on what you generated (`client`, `server` or `fullStack` - meaning both), check out these guides highlighting how to use the generator output for each:\n\n- [Using the generated SDK](SdkGettingStarted)\n- [Using the generated server](ServerGettingStarted)\n"},78788:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>r});const r="# 🌱 oats\n\nThis project aims to provide a solution for generating quality Typescript code from API-describing documents. The only supported format currently is [OpenAPI 3.x](https://www.openapis.org), but there are plans to introduce generators for [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) as well.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the boilerplate a human developer has to write, to reduce the tedium around keeping a client and a server in sync, and to allow devs to focus on just displaying or moving data, without worrying about the structural correctness of that data.\n\n## why?\n\nWhy does this project exists? There are countless OpenAPI generators out there.\n\nThe main goals/differences are:\n\n- Make it work for 1 language (Typescript), and do that well.\n- Make every part of the API replaceable (without forking the project) in case it doesn't suit your needs.\n- Make it easy to customize, to suit a wide variety of use cases out of the box.\n- Make the generated code as easy to read, as if a dev would have written it by hand (or get as close to this as possible).\n\n## get started with OpenAPI\n\n- Check out the [docs](OpenAPI_Workflow) to get started!\n- The [demo](#/demo) page lets you experiment with oats, right here in the browser\n- If you find any issues, I'd greatly appreciate if you [report](https://github.com/oats-ts/oats-ts/issues) it!\n"},98184:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>r});const r="# Read\n\nThe reader step is responsible for\n\n- Reading your OpenAPI 3.x document\n- Parsing it\n- Structurally validating it\n- Resolving it's internal and external [references](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/using-ref)\n- And exposing it to the next step\n\nThe reader that comes with oats by default can be accessed from the [@oats-ts/openapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oats-ts/openapi), but it originates from the [@oats-ts/openapi-reader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oats-ts/openapi-reader) package.\n\n## Examples\n\n```ts\nimport { readers } from '@oats-ts/openapi'\n\n// Reads from the local file system, in json format\nconst jsonFileReader = readers.file.json('oa.json')\n\n// Reads from the local file system, in json format\nconst httpsYamlReader = readers.https.yaml('https://asd.com/oa.yaml')\n\n// Reads from any source in any format\nconst mixedReader = readers.mixed.mixed('http://localhost:3000/oa.json')\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Read\n\nThe reader can be configured to read inputs a few different ways:\n\n- `http` - Reads main input document (and all possible references) from http. Will fail if the main input (or any of the references) are not accessible through http (https, local file system etc).\n- `https` - Reads main input document (and all possible references) from https. Will fail if the main input (or any of the references) are not accessible through https (http, local file, etc).\n- `file` - Reads main input document (and all possible references) from your local file system. Will fail if the main input (or any of the references) are not on your file system.\n- `mixed` - Reads main input document (and all possible references) from any of the sources above. You can have for example a main document in your local file system, that can reference a document through http, which references another document through https.\n- `test` - Reads main input document (and all possible references) from memory. Ideal for testing custom generators end-to-end.\n\n### Parse\n\nFor parsing the document that has been read, there are also a few different built-in solutions:\n\n- `json` - Parses the document(s) using [JSON.parse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse).\n- `yaml` - Parses the document(s) using [yamljs](https://github.com/jeremyfa/yaml.js)\n- `mixed` - First tries to parse the document using `json`, then if that fails, it tries parsing using `yaml`. If both fail, the parsing is considered failed.\n\n## Advanced usage\n\nIn case the solutions above don't suit your needs, you can use the `readers.custom` function, to wich you need to provide a configuration object, with the following properties:\n\n- `path: string` - the entry point where the main document is\n- `sanitize: (path: string) => Try<string>` - Turns `path` into [fully qualified URI](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt)\n- `read: (uri: string) => Promise<Try<string>>` - Reads a document based on a fully qualified URI\n- `parse: (uri: string, input: string) => Promise<Try<OpenAPIObject>>` - Parses the result of a `read` into an `OpenAPIObject` (typings can be found in [@oats-ts/openapi-model](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oats-ts/openapi-model))\n"},68642:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>r});const r="# Error handling\n\nOats generated SDKs don't `throw` (or rather reject, as we are dealing with `Promise`s), unless the response is invalid according to the source OpenAPI document.\n\n## Examples of rejections:\n\n- The `statusCode` doesn't match any of the statuses defined in the source OpenAPI document (eg.: it defines `200`, `400` and `500` but the response has a `403` status code).\n- The `mimeType` doesn't match any of the mime types defined for the given Operation and status code, defined in the source OpenAPI document (eg.: it defines `application/json` and `text/plain` but we get `application/xml`)\n- The response `body` doesn't validate against the schema described in the OpenAPI document\n\nIn all of these cases the server doesn't respect the same OpenAPI document we are working against, this is considered an unexpected situation, hence Oats throws.\n\n## Examples of no rejection:\n\n- The `statusCode`, the response `body` + its `mimeType`, and optionally the response `headers` together match a response option described in the source OpenAPI document.\n- The `statusCode` is outside of the `2xx`, but the first condition is fulfilled (given status code is documented in the source OpenAPI document)\n\nIn this cases the response is documented, and so the responses will be properly parsed, validated, etc, as according to the source OpenAPI document they are to be expected.\n\nThis gives you a flexible and consistent way of error handling, that doesn't hide anything, but rather transparently reflects the servers described behaviour. This is reflected in the previous (usage) example as well. Another practical example displaying really detailed error handling:\n\n```typescript\ntry {\n  // Make a request\n  const response = await sdk.getBook({ path: { bookId: 42 } })\n  // Check each option for status code\n  switch (response.statusCode) {\n    case 200: {\n      // The body is known to be of Book type, and you can safely access fields on it:\n      console.log(response.body.title)\n      break\n    }\n    case 400: {\n      // The body is known to be of AppError[] type:\n      console.error('400 Status code')\n      response.body.forEach((err) => console.error(err.message))\n      break\n    }\n    case 500: {\n      // The body is also known to be of AppError[] type:\n      console.error('500 Status code')\n      response.body.forEach((err) => console.error(err.message))\n      break\n    }\n  }\n} catch (e) {\n  console.error('The server did something unexpected:')\n  // Thrown error will have detailed explanation about what was unexpected.\n  // This can be wrong status code + mime type, response body or response\n  // header format or structure.\n  console.error(e)\n}\n```\n"},95708:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>r});const r="# Getting started (SDK)\n\nIn this guide you'll learn how to generate an SDK and (necessary related code) based on your OpenAPI document.

A big chunk of the generated types is the same as for the server side (JSON schema based types and parameter types), so in this chapter I'm highlighting the differences.\n\n## The SDK type\n\nThe most important type on the client side is the SDK type. This is the type through which we will interact with the backend. In our example the SDK type can be found under `src/generated/sdk`. The type itself, `BookStoreSdk.ts` will look something like this:\n\n```typescript\nimport { AddBookRequest } from '../requests/AddBookRequest'\nimport { GetBookRequest } from '../requests/GetBookRequest'\nimport { GetBooksRequest } from '../requests/GetBooksRequest'\nimport { AddBookResponse } from '../responses/AddBookResponse'\nimport { GetBookResponse } from '../responses/GetBookResponse'\nimport { GetBooksResponse } from '../responses/GetBooksResponse'\n\nexport type BookStoreSdk = {\n  /**\n   * Returns a list of books, can be paginated\n   */\n  getBooks(request: GetBooksRequest): Promise<GetBooksResponse>\n  /**\n   * Creates a new book based on the request body.\n   */\n  addBook(request: AddBookRequest): Promise<AddBookResponse>\n  /**\n   * Returns the book associated with the given bookId\n   */\n  getBook(request: GetBookRequest): Promise<GetBookResponse>\n}\n```\n\nThis type has a method for each [Operation Object](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#operation-object) under `paths` defined in your source OpenAPI document, with which you can execute each request the OpenAPI document defines.\n\nThe aim is to expose **clear functions with no extra nonsense**. When you want to make a request:\n\n- You have to provide a strictly typed input parameter (`request`), with all the user input encapsulated.\n- And when you run it, you get a strictly typed response, with everything relevant from the response encapsulated.\n\n## Request types\n\nRequest types aim to encapsulate all input that you, as the user need to provide. This includes:\n\n- The request `body` (along with its `mimeType`)\n- The `query` parameters\n- The `path` parameters\n- The request `headers`\n\nEach operation has it's dedicated request type, with **only** the parameters, the source OpenAPI document describes.\n\nAn example from the book-store sample, where we have `headers` and `query` parameters:\n\n```typescript\nimport { GetBooksQueryParameters } from '../parameters/GetBooksQueryParameters'\nimport { GetBooksRequestHeaderParameters } from '../parameters/GetBooksRequestHeaderParameters'\n\nexport type GetBooksRequest = {\n  headers?: GetBooksRequestHeaderParameters\n  query?: GetBooksQueryParameters\n}\n```\n\nAn example, where we have a request `body` (along with it's `mimeType`):\n\n```typescript\nimport { Book } from '../types/Book'\n\nexport type AddBookRequest = {\n  mimeType: 'application/json'\n  body: Book\n}\n```\n\nAnd another example where we have `path` parameters:\n\n```typescript\nimport { GetBookPathParameters } from '../parameters/GetBookPathParameters'\n\nexport type GetBookRequest = {\n  path: GetBookPathParameters\n}\n```\n\n## Response types\n\nResponse types aim to encapsulate the responses defined in your source OpenAPI document without ambiguity. Response types can have the following fields (depending how your OpenAPI document defines responses):\n\n- The `statusCode`\n- The response `body` (along with its `mimeType`)\n- The response `headers`\n\nAs an example, let's look at the response type used for the `getBooks` operation, called `GetBooksResponse`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { GetBooks200ResponseHeaderParameters } from '../parameters/GetBooks200ResponseHeaderParameters'\nimport { AppError } from '../types/AppError'\nimport { Book } from '../types/Book'\n\nexport type GetBooksResponse =\n  | {\n      statusCode: 200\n      mimeType: 'application/json'\n      body: Book[]\n      headers: GetBooks200ResponseHeaderParameters\n    }\n  | {\n      statusCode: 400\n      mimeType: 'application/json'\n      body: AppError[]\n    }\n  | {\n      statusCode: 500\n      mimeType: 'application/json'\n      body: AppError[]\n    }\n```\n\nSince it is a union type of all the different responses, and they are discriminated by the `statusCode` and `mimeType` fields, you can't mix up which `statusCode` belongs with which response `body` or `headers`. This way, when you get a `GetBooksResponse`, checking the `statusCode` (and the `mimeType` in case you have multiple of those), `headers` and `body` types will not be a guesswork anymore.\n"},19132:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>r});const r="# SDK usage\n\nTo start using the SDK, you will need an implementation of the previously described SDK type. Oats generates an SDK implementation class (`BookStoreSdkImpl` in our case), that you can find next to the SDK type (in `src/generated/sdk`).\n\nTo instantiate this class, we'll need an input parameter called `adapter` of type `ClientAdapter`. This adapter is responsible for bridiging the generated code with a request library. Oats ships with a single client adapter based on the [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) API, but you can roll your own, by either extending the default `FetchClientAdapter`, or simply implementing the `ClientAdapter` type.\n\n```typescript\nimport { FetchClientAdapter } from '@oats-ts/openapi-fetch-client-adapter'\nimport { BookStoreSdkImpl } from './generated/sdk/BookStoreSdkImpl'\n\n// Instantiate adapter with a base URL, where your spec compliant server is running\nconst adapter = new FetchClientAdapter({ url: 'http://localhost:3000' })\n// Instantiate the SDK with the adapter\nconst sdk = new BookStoreSdkImpl(adapter)\n```\n\nOnce you have your SDK instance, you can use it plain and simple, as you would expect. Below are a few simple examples of using the different operations on the generated SDK.\n\n### addBook\n\nThis operation uses a request body, with JSON mime type.\n\n```typescript\n// Create a new Book\nconst response = await sdk.addBook({\n  mimeType: 'application/json',\n  body: { id: -1, author: 'Balázs', title: 'Test book', price: 10 },\n})\n// If the statusCode is 201, we know the request was a success\nif (response.statusCode === 201) {\n  // We (and the compiler) also know the body will be of Book type\n  const book = response.body\n  console.log('You created this book', book)\n} else {\n  // We (and the compiler) know the body is of AppError[] type\n  // Error types are also user defined like all other types\n  response.body.forEach((err) => console.log(err.message))\n}\n```\n\n### getBook\n\nThis operation uses a path parameter.\n\n```typescript\nconst response = await sdk.getBook({ path: { bookId: 1 } })\nif (response.statusCode === 200) {\n  const book = response.body\n  console.log('This is your book', book)\n} else {\n  response.body.forEach((err) => console.log(err.message))\n}\n```\n\n### getBooks\n\nThis operation uses a mix of query and header parameters.\n\n```typescript\nconst response = await sdk.getBooks({\n  query: { offset: 1 },\n  headers: { 'x-limit': 3 },\n})\nif (response.statusCode === 200) {\n  const books = response.body\n  books.forEach((book) => console.log(book))\n} else {\n  response.body.forEach((err) => console.log(err.message))\n}\n```\n"},89218:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>r});const r="# Example API implementation\n\nLet's go back to `BookStoreApiImpl` and implement some simple logic. In this guide I'm going to store data in memory, but since all API methods return `Promise`s, you can use whatever data storage you choose.\n\n- First I'm adding an array with `Book` typed items, this is going to be our data storage (replace it with a database, another HTTP service, or whatever else you want)\n- I'm adding a hardcoded dummy item to this array, so it's not empty\n- Finally I'm implementing the `getBooks` method\n\n```typescript\nexport class BookStoreApiImpl implements BookStoreApi {\n  private readonly books: Book[] = [{ id: 1, author: 'Balázs', price: 10, title: 'test book' }]\n\n  async getBooks(request: GetBooksServerRequest): Promise<GetBooksResponse> {\n    return {\n      statusCode: 200,\n      mimeType: 'application/json',\n      body: this.books,\n      headers: {\n        'x-length': this.books.length,\n      },\n    }\n  }\n  async addBook(request: AddBookServerRequest): Promise<AddBookResponse> {\n    throw new Error('Method not implemented.')\n  }\n  async getBook(request: GetBookServerRequest): Promise<GetBookResponse> {\n    throw new Error('Method not implemented.')\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you do this along with the guide, you'll see that you have content assist and type checking for the response. The `statusCode` field is only allowed to be `200`, `400` and `500` (just as our source OpenAPI document defines this). The `body` and `headers` fields also only allow properly typed data.\n"},28102:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>r});const r="# Implement CORS\n\nIn this guide you'll learn how to make your Oats+express based server CORS enabled.\n\n## What is CORS?\n\nCORS or cross site resource sharing is a mechanism used between HTTP servers and web browsers. When browser scripts make an HTTP request (using [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) or [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)) to a different origin, there are a few additional rules the server need to comply with in order to allow communication with the browser. If you want to learn more about CORS (which I would highly recommend) check out the [**official CORS docs**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), but in this guide I summarized the most relevant parts.\n\n## What is a different origin?\n\nA different origin is defined as different domain or port.\n\n- So if you open `https://foo.com` in the browser, and it's script makes a request to `https://bar.com`, or even `https://foo.com:5000` (same domain, protocol, etc but different port), it counts as a cross origin request.\n- But from `https://foo.com` to `https://foo.com/api/something` or `https://foo.com/api/foo?foo=bar`, is the same origin, as only the path and query part of the URL are different.\n\nThis means if you are serving your frontend using the same express server (domain + port) as where you serve your API from, and you don't want to expose your API for other browser apps to be used, you are lucky, as you don't need to worry about the rest of this guide.\n\n## What are the CORS mechanics?\n\nThere are two ways the browser may inspect, if the request a client side script made is \"approved\" by the server or not.\n\n### 1. Simple requests\n\n`GET`, `POST` or `HEAD` request, without any extra request headers are called simple requests. In this case the browser simply hits your endpoint, and expects the response to have certain `Access-Control-*` response headers confirming, that the origin, the request is coming from is allowed. If it doesn't, the request will error out, and your client side code will not have access to the response.\n\n### 2. Pre-flight requests\n\nIn cases when you are using other request methods, or you want to send extra request headers, it is a pre-flighted request. In this case the client will first attempt a request to the same URL, but with the `OPTIONS` method, which is called a pre-flight request. In this request it communicates using certain `Access-Control-*` request headers, what method and optionally what request headers did you originally intend to use, from what origin. If the server sends back the appropriate response headers to this OPTIONS request, the client will then attempt to make the original request you intended to, otherwise it rejects your request, and your client side code will not have access to the response.\n\n## How does Oats help?\n\nOats can generate express `Router`s that deal with CORS, customized to your exact OpenAPI based backend. To enable this, you need to modify your generator preset a bit, as CORS is off by default. The minimum amount of configuration you need to provide for functional CORS is the allowed origins, but you can customize the full suite of CORS headers:\n\n```typescript\nconst oats = require('@oats-ts/openapi')\n\noats.generate({\n  logger: oats.loggers.simple(),\n  reader: oats.readers.https.json(\n    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oats-ts/oats-schemas/master/schemas/book-store.json',\n  ),\n  validator: oats.validator(),\n  generator: oats.generator({\n    nameProvider: oats.nameProviders.default(),\n    pathProvider: oats.pathProviders.default('src/generated'),\n    children: oats.presets.server({\n      cors: {\n        getAllowedOrigins: (path, method, operation) => ['http://localhost:5000'],\n        isMethodAllowed: (path, method, operation) => true,\n        isRequestHeaderAllowed: (header, path, method, operation) => true,\n        isResponseHeaderAllowed: (header, path, method, operation) => true,\n        isCredentialsAllowed: (path, method, operation) => false,\n        getMaxAge: (path, method, operation) => 10,\n      },\n    }),\n  }),\n  writer: oats.writers.typescript.file({\n    format: oats.formatters.prettier({\n      parser: 'typescript',\n    }),\n  }),\n})\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\n- `getAllowedOrigins` **`(mandatory)`** - Either return an array of allowed origins, eg.: `['https://foo.com']`, or return a `boolean` to either allow or disallow any origin.\n- `isMethodAllowed` **`(optional)`** - Only called with `path`s and `method`s occuring in the OpenAPI document, and allows you to further restrict these. Return `true` to allow the given `path` and `method` combination (default) or `false` to disallow it.\n- `isRequestHeaderAllowed` and `isResponseHeaderAllowed` **`(optional)`** - Only called with headers (request or response respectively) that occur in your OpenAPI document, and allows you to further restrict them. Return `true` to allow given header for given path and method (default) or `false` to disallow it.\n- `isCredentialsAllowed` **`(optional)`** - Only called with `path`s and `method`s occuring in the OpenAPI document, and sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header. This effectively gives cross-origin access to cookies set by CORS requests. Return `true` to allow this or `false` (default) to disallow\n- `getMaxAge` **`(optional)`** - Sets how long pre-flight requests can be cached (in seconds). By default caching is not specified.\n\n## Using the generated output\n\nIf you generate again with CORS enabled for the same document:\n\n- You'll have a new CORS configuration object, `bookStoreCorsConfiguration.ts`\n- Your express routers will now respond to simple CORS requests with the appropriate CORS headers using the above configuration\n- A new CORS router has been generated, responsible for handling the pre-flight `OPTIONS` requests, you'll need to add this router to your app.\n\nIf you followed the server guides so far, then the only thing you have to change is the commented lines:\n\n```typescript\n// createBookStoreApp.ts\nimport express from 'express'\nimport { ExpressServerAdapter } from '@oats-ts/openapi-express-server-adapter'\n\nimport { BookStoreApiImpl } from './BookStoreApiImpl'\nimport { createBookStoreAppRouter } from './generated/routers/createBookStoreAppRouter'\nimport { createBookStoreContextRouter } from './generated/routers/createBookStoreContextRouter'\n// This is new\nimport { createBookStoreCorsRouter } from './generated/routers/createBookStoreCorsRouter'\n\nexport function createBookStoreApp() {\n  const app = express()\n  app.use(json())\n\n  createBookStoreContextRouter(app, new BookStoreApiImpl(), new ExpressServerAdapter())\n  // This is new, make sure it's AFTER the Context router\n  createBookStoreCorsRouter(app)\n  createBookStoreAppRouter(app)\n\n  return app\n}\n```\n\nThat's it your server should be CORS enabled based on your OpenAPI document, respecting your restrictions, and using your origins.\n"},76651:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>r});const r="# Getting started (Server)\n\nThis guide will help you getting started with generating server side code using Oats. As for all examples, we are going to use the [book store](https://github.com/oats-ts/oats-schemas/blob/master/schemas/book-store.json) example (so it's recommended you try using this first, if you are unfamiliar with Oats)!\n\n## Set up the generator\n\n- Install `@oats-ts/openapi` in your project (`npm i --dev @oats-ts/openapi`)\n- Create a file called `oats.js` file in your project\n- Add the content below to `oats.js`\n- (Optional) Add an entry to `\"scripts\"` in your `package.json` with this command: `node ./oats.js`\n- Run this file either with the script (`npm run <script-name>`) or directly (`node ./oats.js`)\n\n```javascript\n// oats.js\nconst oats = require('@oats-ts/openapi')\n\noats.generate({\n  logger: oats.loggers.simple(),\n  reader: oats.readers.https.json(\n    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oats-ts/oats-schemas/master/schemas/book-store.json',\n  ),\n  validator: oats.validator(),\n  generator: oats.generator({\n    nameProvider: oats.nameProviders.default(),\n    pathProvider: oats.pathProviders.default('src/generated'),\n    children: oats.presets.server(),\n  }),\n  writer: oats.writers.typescript.file({\n    format: oats.formatters.prettier({\n      parser: 'typescript',\n    }),\n  }),\n})\n```\n\nNow you sould have a `generated` folder in `src`, that contains the generated code, in neatly organized subfolders.\n"},4873:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>r});const r="# Express server setup\n\nBefore we write any business logic, let's create a functional server that exposes the appropriate endpoints, and we can test it locally. This involves the following steps:\n\n## Create an API implementation\n\nFirst we need to create an implementation of the previously described API Type. In this example we are going to use a class implementation, as it lends itself for our purpose. Start by creating a class, that implements `BookStoreApi`. A modern IDE (like VS Code) should be able to help you creating a stub for each method, and add the appropriate imports:\n\n```typescript\n// BookStoreApiImpl.ts\nimport { BookStoreApi } from './generated/api/BookStoreApi'\nimport { AddBookServerRequest } from './generated/requests/AddBookServerRequest'\nimport { GetBookServerRequest } from './generated/requests/GetBookServerRequest'\nimport { GetBooksServerRequest } from './generated/requests/GetBooksServerRequest'\nimport { AddBookResponse } from './generated/responses/AddBookResponse'\nimport { GetBookResponse } from './generated/responses/GetBookResponse'\nimport { GetBooksResponse } from './generated/responses/GetBooksResponse'\n\nexport class BookStoreApiImpl implements BookStoreApi {\n  async getBooks(request: GetBooksServerRequest): Promise<GetBooksResponse> {\n    throw new Error('Method not implemented.')\n  }\n  async addBook(request: AddBookServerRequest): Promise<AddBookResponse> {\n    throw new Error('Method not implemented.')\n  }\n  async getBook(request: GetBookServerRequest): Promise<GetBookResponse> {\n    throw new Error('Method not implemented.')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Create an express app\n\nNow that you have an API implementation that at least compiles (even though it lacks proper business logic at this point), you can put together the `express` server.\n\nOats generates functionality that interacts with express in the form of `Router` factory functions. These functions can either\n\n- Produce a new express `Router` with the attached functionality,\n- Or they can attach their functionality to an existing `IRouter`, that's always the first, optional value of the factory functions.\n\nThe \"app\" returned by the `express` function call is an `IRouter` as well, so in our simple example we are going to pick the second option, and attach the functionality to the app.\n\n```typescript\n// createBookStoreApp.ts\nimport express from 'express'\nimport { ExpressServerAdapter } from '@oats-ts/openapi-express-server-adapter'\n\nimport { BookStoreApiImpl } from './BookStoreApiImpl'\nimport { createBookStoreAppRouter } from './generated/routers/createBookStoreAppRouter'\nimport { createBookStoreContextRouter } from './generated/routers/createBookStoreContextRouter'\n\nexport function createBookStoreApp() {\n  // Create an app, and add a body parser as usual\n  const app = express()\n  app.use(json())\n\n  // Add router/middleware, that exposes an instance of your API implementation,\n  // and an adapter connecting the generated code and the framework on response.locals.\n  createBookStoreContextRouter(app, new BookStoreApiImpl(), new ExpressServerAdapter())\n\n  // Add routers handling each operation. These routers will use the API implementation\n  // With the appropriate parameters, and use it's return value to construct a response.\n  createBookStoreAppRouter(app)\n\n  // Return the app\n  return app\n}\n```\n\n## Create a runnable file\n\nIn order to be able to test this, lets create a file called `index.ts`, where you create and start an instance of your express app:\n\n```typescript\n// index.ts\nimport { createBookStoreApp } from './createBookStoreApp'\n\ncreateBookStoreApp().listen(5000)\n```\n\n## Make running this easy\n\nIn production I'd recommend compiling this first. But for development we are just going to use `ts-node` (command line tool, that allows running typescript without compilation). Let's create a simple `\"start\"` script in `package.json`, that runs `ts-node` with our entry point, `index.ts`:\n\n```json\n// package.json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"oats\": \"node ./oats.ts\",\n    \"build\": \"tsc\",\n    \"start\": \"ts-node ./src/index.ts\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@oats-ts/openapi\": \"0.0.43\",\n    \"ts-node\": \"10.9.1\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Let's test if this works!\n\nNow we have an easy to run server that should handle the appropriate requests, so let's test if it works:\n\n- Use `npm start` to start the server\n- Make a request to one of the endpoints, eg.: `GET http://localhost:5000/books` (I'd recommend using [**Postman**](https://www.postman.com), [**Insomnia**](https://insomnia.rest) or any other HTTP tester tool, to make your job easier)\n- You should get the standard express error response, with `500` as status, and the stack trace of our `throw new Error('Method not implemented.')` statement, originating from the appropraite method (in this case `getBooks`).\n"},97292:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>r});const r="# Server types\n\nThis guide will showcase the main types generated for the server side. A big chunk of the generated types is the same as for the client side (JSON schema based types and parameter types), so in this chapter I'm highlighting the differences.\n\n## The API type\n\nThe most important type on the server side is the API type. You'll need an implementation of this type (can be a class or a plain object, if you don't need to share context), that will carry all the business logic for your server. How you split up logic here is completely up to you. In our example the API type can be found under `src/generated/api`. The type itself, `BookStoreApi.ts` will look something like this:\n\n```typescript\nimport { AddBookServerRequest } from '../requests/AddBookServerRequest'\nimport { GetBookServerRequest } from '../requests/GetBookServerRequest'\nimport { GetBooksServerRequest } from '../requests/GetBooksServerRequest'\nimport { AddBookServerResponse } from '../responses/AddBookServerResponse'\nimport { GetBookServerResponse } from '../responses/GetBookServerResponse'\nimport { GetBooksServerResponse } from '../responses/GetBooksServerResponse'\n\nexport type BookStoreApi = {\n  /**\n   * Returns a list of books, can be paginated\n   */\n  getBooks(request: GetBooksServerRequest): Promise<GetBooksServerResponse>\n  /**\n   * Creates a new book based on the request body.\n   */\n  addBook(request: AddBookServerRequest): Promise<AddBookServerResponse>\n  /**\n   * Returns the book associated with the given bookId\n   */\n  getBook(request: GetBookServerRequest): Promise<GetBookServerResponse>\n}\n```\n\nIf you have checked out the SDK guide, it may look familiar and that is no accident. The main difference is, that we have separate request and response types for the API type. Let's check out why we have these differences!\n\n## (Server) Request types\n\nRequest types aim to encapsulate all input that the caller has provided for a specific request. This includes:\n\n- The request `body` (along with its `mimeType`)\n- The `query` parameters\n- The `path` parameters\n- The request `headers`\n- The `cookies` sent back by the browser (this is unique to the server request, as browsers can't directly set cookie headers)\n\nEach operation has it's dedicated server request type, with **only** the parameters, the source OpenAPI document describes.\n\nAn example from the book-store sample, where we have `headers` and `query` parameters:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Try } from '@oats-ts/openapi-runtime'\nimport { GetBooksQueryParameters } from '../parameters/GetBooksQueryParameters'\nimport { GetBooksRequestHeaderParameters } from '../parameters/GetBooksRequestHeaderParameters'\n\nexport type GetBooksServerRequest = {\n  headers: Try<GetBooksRequestHeaderParameters>\n  query: Try<GetBooksQueryParameters>\n}\n```\n\nAn example, where we have a request `body` (along with it's `mimeType`):\n\n```typescript\nimport { Try } from '@oats-ts/openapi-runtime'\nimport { Book } from '../types/Book'\n\nexport type AddBookServerRequest = {\n  mimeType: 'application/json'\n  body: Try<Book>\n}\n```\n\nAnd another example where we have `path` parameters:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Try } from '@oats-ts/openapi-runtime'\nimport { GetBookPathParameters } from '../parameters/GetBookPathParameters'\n\nexport type GetBookServerRequest = {\n  path: Try<GetBookPathParameters>\n}\n```\n\n### The Try type\n\nWhile on the client (SDK) side we are building the request ourselves, on the server side we need to prepare for missing or malformed input parameters. This is true for all of the above parameters. Since all parameters can be automatically parsed, I needed to find a way to communicate possible errors clearly, and let the user of the generated code decide what should happen in case of errors.\n\nThis is why the `Try` type was introduced, that wraps each field of the generated server requests. This type exists, as Typescript doesn't have [typed caches](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/8677) (nor [typed promise rejections](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/6283)), so the `Try` type encapsulates a \"fail-able\" value, that can be either a `Success` of a `Failure`. It has the appropriate type guards `isSuccess` and `isFailure` respectively, which are exposed by the `@oats-ts/openapi-runtime` package. A `Success` has a generic `data` field, and a `Failure` has an `issues` field of `Issue[]` type, that contains the array of issues that caused the value to be a `Failure`.\n\n## (Server) Response types\n\nServer response types aim to encapsulate the responses defined in your source OpenAPI document without ambiguity. For each of the API methods you need to return eventually a `Promise` of the appropriate server response type. Server response types can have the following fields (depending how your OpenAPI document defines responses):\n\n- The `statusCode`\n- The response `body` (along with its `mimeType`)\n- The response `headers`\n- The `cookies` set by the server\n\nAs an example, let's look at the response type used for the `getBooks` operation, called `GetBooksResponse`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { GetBooks200ResponseHeaderParameters } from '../parameters/GetBooks200ResponseHeaderParameters'\nimport { AppError } from '../types/AppError'\nimport { Book } from '../types/Book'\n\nexport type GetBooksServerResponse =\n  | {\n      statusCode: 200\n      mimeType: 'application/json'\n      body: Book[]\n      headers: GetBooks200ResponseHeaderParameters\n    }\n  | {\n      statusCode: 400\n      mimeType: 'application/json'\n      body: AppError[]\n    }\n  | {\n      statusCode: 500\n      mimeType: 'application/json'\n      body: AppError[]\n    }\n```\n\nSince it is a union type of all the different responses, and they are discriminated by the `statusCode` and `mimeType` fields, you can't mix up which `statusCode` belongs with which response `body`, `headers` or `cookies`.\n\n**Tip:** When returning a response, always define the `statusCode` and `mimeType` first, as they narrow down the type of the rest of the fields, and you get better content assist immediately.\n"},72033:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>r});const r="# Validate\n\nThe valididator step is responsible for taking the output of the [reader](OpenAPI-Reader) step, and checking for structural and semantic errors.\n\nThe validator that comes with oats by default can be accessed from the [@oats-ts/openapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oats-ts/openapi), but it originates from the [@oats-ts/openapi-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oats-ts/openapi-validator) package.\n\n## Examples\n\n```ts\nimport { validator } from '@oats-ts/openapi';\n\n// Default validator\nconst defaultValidator = validator();\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe validator can be used configuration free. This is the default behaviour, and it ensures that the generators maintained as part of the oats project run correctly with your OpenAPI document.\n\nConfiguring the validator to suit your needs is possible, but currently experimental, docs are TBD, as the internal APIs might change.\n"},91447:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>r});const r="# Welcome to the docs!\n\nOats in one sentence is a free and open source project, that can generate Typescript code from your OpenAPI documents.\n\n## How to get started?\n\n- [**SDK Guide**](SdkGenerate) - If you are a frontend developer, or you want to generate a Typescript SDK based on an OpenAPI document\n- [**Server guide**](ServerGenerate) - If you are a backend developer, you want to focus on moving data, and generate the tedious parts (routing, parameter parsing etc.)\n\n## Motivation\n\n**Why does this project exist?**\n\nDuring my job as a Typescript dev, I'm continously running into the same problem: while the frontend (and usually the backend too) is strictly typed, the integration between them is unclear to everyone. Backend devs produce usually poorly written wiki pages about their services, that then nobody updates. In turn the frontend continously breaks, as there is no way to figure out at compile time, if its still in sync with the backend, and the only solution is extremely extensive testing.\n\nDescribing a service / Rest API in a language agnostic way (like OpenAPI), and building upon that is a good first step, but it still needs maintenance on both the backend and frontend side. Here comes the idea of generating the code thats used for the interaction between the 2 (or more) sides. The idea is not new, unfortunately I had many issues with the existing tooling.\n\nIf you want to use the official OpenAPI code generators, you need Java, a Java library that you either build yourself or download as a jar, then you run it and hope whatever comes out of it is usable (which for me it wasn't).\n\nThere are other open source alternatives, that fit in the Javascript/Typescript ecosystem well. However they are usually characterized by limited configuration, no clear path to extend them, without forking the project or redoing most of the work the devs have already done. They also often implemented the easy stuff (types from schemas, and basic client side SDK), however more involved things (like advanced types, references to other OpenAPI documents, different style parameter serialization, etc.) are left out, as the original developers didn't need these.\n\n**This is why I started Oats.** I want to provide code generators, that produce well thought out, spec compliant code, for both the frontend and backend.\n\nThe goals in short were:\n\n- Make it work for 1 language (Typescript), and do that well.\n- Make every part of the public API replaceable (without forking the project) in case it doesn't suit your needs.\n- Make it easy to customize, to suit a wide variety of use cases out of the box.\n- Make the generated code as easy to read, as if a dev would have written it by hand (or get as close to this as possible).\n"},53467:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>r});const r="# Workflow\n\nThis guide will walk you through on how to get started with oats and OpenAPI.\n\n## Set up the code generator\n\n### Dependencies\n\nLet's assume that you already have a Typescript project. The first thing you'll need is the core oats package (`@oats-ts/oats-ts`), and the OpenAPI specific libararies for oats (`@oats-ts/openapi`). Additionally we are going to write the generator's configuration in typescript as well, and to make it easy to run it, we are going to add `ts-node` to the project as well:\n\n```bash\nnpm i ts-node @oats-ts/oats-ts @oats-ts/openapi\n```\n\n### Generator configuration\n\nNext we need to put together the generator configuration, and we need to run this code.\n\nLet's assume, that your code lives in the `src` folder. Let's create a `generate.ts` file here (it's an ordinary typescript file, you can call it whatever you like):\n\n```ts\n// src/generate.ts\n\nimport { generate } from '@oats-ts/oats-ts'\nimport {\n  nameProviders,\n  generator,\n  pathProviders,\n  presets,\n  readers,\n  writers,\n  formatters,\n  loggers,\n  validator,\n} from '@oats-ts/openapi'\n\nimport prettierConfig from './.prettierrc.json'\n\ngenerate({\n  logger: loggers.simple(),\n  reader: readers.https.json('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oats-ts/oats-schemas/master/schemas/book-store.json'),\n  validator: validator(),\n  generator: generator({\n    nameProvider: nameProviders.default(),\n    pathProvider: pathProviders.default('src/generated'),\n    children: presets.fullStack(),\n  }),\n  writer: writers.typescript({\n    format: formatters.prettier(prettierConfig),\n  }),\n})\n```\n\n### Breakdown\n\n- `generate` - The main generator harness. Responsible for coordinating the generator steps.\n  - `logger` - Logs the generator events as they happen. Can be either `simple` or `verbose`. If ommited, you will have no feedback about what's happening, so it's recommended to use a logger.\n  - `reader` - Reads the root OpenAPI document, resolving it's internal (and external) dependencies. Also structurally validates the document. Can read from `file`, `http` or `https` in `json` and `yaml` formats. For this example we are using a dummy OpenAPI document I use for testing, see more here: https://github.com/oats-ts/oats-schemas .\n  - `validator` - Takes the output of the reader, and validates it for any possible inconsistencies or issues that might trip up the generators.\n  - `generator` - Takes the output of the reader, and generates Typescript syntax tree from it. The work of the generator is split into smaller, single responsibilty code-generators, that are responsible for a single concern, eg.: generate schema types or parameter serializers.\n    - `nameProvider` - Function determining how each generated artifact should be named.\n    - `pathProvider` - Function determining what disk location each artifact should be written to.\n    - `children` - Either a list of single-responsible code-generators, or a preset, which is a collection of these generators. Individual generators are exposed in the `generators` object, coming from the `'@oats-ts/openapi'` package.\n  - `writer` - Takes the output of the generator, stringifies the syntax tree (SourceFiles), and then writes them to the disk.\n    - `format` - Function formatting the output before it gets written to the disk. In this case using the prettier formatter, and with the config the project is already using.\n\n## Run the code generator\n\nTo run it, you can either compile it and run it using the `node` command, or you can use `ts-node` to save the extra step (we are opting for this in this guide). You don't need any special runner.\n\n```bash\nts-node src/generate.ts\n```\n\nWhich will output something like:\n\n```bash\n✔ reader step completed using \"@oats-ts/openapi-reader\"\n✔ validator step completed using \"@oats-ts/openapi-validator\"\n✔ generator step completed using \"@oats-ts/openapi-generators\"\n✔ writer step completed using \"@oats-ts/typescript-writer\"\n```\n\nFor convenience, you could create an entry in your `package.json`, that runs this command, eg.:\n\n```jsonc\n{\n  \"name\": \"your-project\",\n  // ...\n  \"scripts\": {\n    // ...\n    \"oats\": \"ts-node src/generate.ts\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen you can just do this, for subsequent generator runs:\n\n```bash\nnpm run oats\n```\n\n## Where to go from here?\n\n- If you this looks interesting, check out the [demo](#/demo) page, where you can see the outputs of each generator, with either your OpenAPI inputs or samples!\n- If you find any issues, I'd greatly appreciate if you [report](https://github.com/oats-ts/oats-ts/issues) it!\n"},84287:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>r});const r="# Write\n\nThe writer step is responsible for taking the output of the [generator step](OpenAPI-Generator) and writing it's outputs to the disk. The typescript writer takes typescript `SourceFile`s (this is Typescript's in-memory representation of an AST + file location) and writes them to the desired location.\n\nAdditionally it can add leading / trailing comments to each of your generated files. This is ideal for warning people that the file is generated and should be edited manually, or for disabling certain linter rules for the generated files.\n\n## Example\n\n### Basic usage\n\nBasic usage, formats the code using your project's prettier configuration. Formatter can be omitted, but the generated code won't be pretty in this case.\n\n```ts\nimport { writers, formatters } from '@oats-ts/openapi'\nimport prettierConfig from './.prettierrc.json'\n\nconst writer = writers.typescript.file({\n  format: formatters.prettier(prettierConfig),\n})\n```\n\n### With comments\n\nAdds comments. First leading comment warns about the fact that the file is generated, the second disables some `eslint` rules. The trailing comment re-enables these rules, so other code is not affected **(this is just an example, generated code will not break these specific rules)**.\n\n```ts\nimport { writers, formatters } from '@oats-ts/openapi'\nimport prettierConfig from './.prettierrc.json'\n\nconst writer = writers.typescript.file({\n  format: formatters.prettier(prettierConfig),\n  comments: {\n    leadingComments: [\n      {\n        type: 'block',\n        text: 'This is a generated file, please do not edit by hand!',\n      },\n      {\n        type: 'block',\n        text: 'eslint-disable no-console, no-alert',\n      },\n    ],\n    trailingComments: [\n      {\n        type: 'block',\n        text: 'eslint-enable no-console, no-alert',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe `writers.typescript` object exposes 3 factory functions:\n\n- `file` - Writes the generated code to the disk. Configuration:\n  - `comments: CommentsConfig` - Adds leading / trailing comments to each generated file.\n  - `format(code: string): string` - Formats the code, before writing to the disk. Default formatter shipping with oats is `formatters.prettier()`.\n- `memory` - Doesn't write the output to the disk, returns the generated code instead as `{ path: string; content: string }[]` instead. Configuration:\n  - `comments: CommentsConfig` - Adds leading / trailing comments to each generated file.\n  - `format(code: string): string` - Formats the code, before writing to the disk. Default formatter shipping with oats is `formatters.prettier()`.\n- `custom` - Customizeable `write` function, ideal if you want to send the output over the wire for example. Configuration:\n  - `comments: CommentsConfig` - Adds leading / trailing comments to each generated file.\n  - `format(code: string): string` - Formats the code, before writing to the disk. Default formatter shipping with oats is `formatters.prettier()`.\n  - `write(path: string, content: string): Promise<void>` - Writes the stringified, possibly formatted `content` to the disk at `path`.\n"},38957:function(e,t,o){"use strict";var r=this&&this.__importDefault||function(e){return e&&e.__esModule?e:{default:e}};Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0}),t.App=void 0,o(38419);const n=r(o(67294)),a=o(18592),A=o(49818),s=o(68835),i=o(87640),l=o(32869),c=o(2968),d=o(35194),u=o(89019);t.App=()=>{const e=(0,d.useColorModeContext)();return n.default.createElement(c.ColorModeContext.Provider,{value:e},n.default.createElement("div",{className:(t=e.colorMode,a.css`
