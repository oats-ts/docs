In this article I'm listing the most common \"mistakes\" that you can make, that doesn't make your OpenAPI document invalid, but effectively prevents tooling from outputing usable documentation or code.\n\n## TODO"},88213:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>A});const A="# Custom Generators\n\nTODO"},35625:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>A});const A="# Generate\n\nThe generator step is responsible for taking the validated output of the [reader](OpenAPI-Reader), and turning it into an intermediate representation (Typescript [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) in this case), that can be then turned into source code. The OpenAPI generator itself doesn't do much, the work is distributed to single responsiblity generators, that are responsible for generating one thing (like types from the JSON schemas, or serializers for parameters). They also provide means for other generators to access references to their generated content.\n\nThe generators that comes with oats by default can be accessed from the [@oats-ts/openapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oats-ts/openapi), but it originates from the [@oats-ts/openapi-generators](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oats-ts/openapi-generators) package.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Using individual generators\n\nYou can configure your generator from a set of code generators of your choosing. For this approach, it's the easiest to use `generators.create` from the [@oats-ts/openapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oats-ts/openapi) package. You can use the generator names (see below) as the first argument, and optionally the approriate configuration object as the second argument (autocomplete will help with this).\n\n```ts\nimport { generator, nameProviders, pathProviders, generators } from '@oats-ts/openapi'\n\nconst withGenerators = generator({\n  nameProvider: nameProviders.default(),\n  pathProvider: pathProviders.default('src/generated'),\n  children: [\n    generators.create('oats/type', { documentation: false }),\n    generators.create('oats/type-guard'),\n    generators.create('oats/type-validator'),\n  ],\n})\n```\n\n### Using presets\n\nYou can also use presets (I'd recommend starting with presets). Presets are a set of generators grouped toghether. The ones available currently are `presets.client()`, `presets.server()` and `presets.fullStack()`. The simplest way is to use the preset without any configuration:\n\n```ts\nimport { generator, nameProviders, pathProviders, presets } from '@oats-ts/openapi'\n\nconst withDefaults = generator({\n  nameProvider: nameProviders.default(),\n  pathProvider: pathProviders.default('src/generated'),\n  children: presets.client(),\n})\n```\n\nPresets offer configuration options, that affect possibly multiple individual generators. In this case we are disabling the documentation for all the generators that support this option:\n\n```ts\nconst withOverrides = generator({\n  nameProvider: nameProviders.default(),\n  pathProvider: pathProviders.default('src/generated'),\n  children: presets.client({\n    documentation: false,\n    validateResponses: false,\n  }),\n})\n```\n\nIn case you want to really fine tune presets, you can override the configuration for individual generators as well. In this case we are only generating documentation for types:\n\n```ts\nconst withOverrides = generator({\n  nameProvider: nameProviders.default(),\n  pathProvider: pathProviders.default('src/generated'),\n  children: presets.client({ documentation: false }).override({ 'oats/type': { documentation: true } }),\n})\n```\n\n### Mixing presets and generators\n\nPresets and individual generators can be used together:\n\n```ts\nconst withPresetsAndGenerators = generator({\n  nameProvider: nameProviders.default(),\n  pathProvider: pathProviders.default('src/generated'),\n  children: [presets.client(), generators.create('oats/express-cors-router-factory')],\n})\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe main `generator` function can be configured with an object having the following properties:\n\n- `nameProvider: (input: any, originalName: string | undefined, target: string) => string` - A function that determines how each generated artifact is called. For reasonable, convention respecting names use `nameProviders.default()`\n  - `input` is the part of the OpenAPI object tree that the given artifact is based on (eg.: A Schema object or Operation object).\n  - `originalName` optionally appears for pieces of the OpenAPI document, where the name is not part of the object itself (eg.: Schema object).\n  - `target` is one of the names listed below.\n- `pathProvider: (input: any, name: NameProvider, target: string) => string` - A function that determines where in the disk each artifact is written to (`SourceFile#fileName`). Check `pathProviders.*` for options.\n  - `input` is the part of the OpenAPI object tree that the given artifact is based on (eg.: A Schema object or Operation object).\n  - `name` is a simplified function that takes the `input` and the `target` and delegates to the `nameProvider`.\n  - `target` is one of the names listed below.\n- `children: OpenAPIGenerator | OpenAPIGenerator[]` - A single generator or a list of generators. See available ones below.\n- `noEmit?: boolean = false` - When `true`, the generators return no output `SourceFile`s.\n- `name?: string = 'root'` - The name of the root generator, shows up in logs.\n\n## Available generators\n\nThere are a number of code generators available. These are part of certain presets, but can also be used individually, using `generators.create`.

In these guides I'm going to use the [book store](https://github.com/oats-ts/oats-schemas/blob/master/schemas/book-store.json) example:\n\n```text\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/oats-ts/oats-schemas/master/schemas/book-store.json\n```\n\n## Install Oats generator modules\n\nTo get generating, you'll need the main Oats module. This simply contains all that you need to generate, but you won't need anything from this module, when using the generated code:\n\n```text\nnpm i --dev @oats-ts/openapi\n```\n\n## Configure Oats\n\nOats borrows its configuration philosophy from Webpack, meaning code is configuration. Let's create a file called `oats.js` (you can call it whatever you want), and add a basic Oats configuration:\n\n```javascript\nconst oats = require('@oats-ts/openapi')\n\noats.generate({\n  logger: oats.loggers.simple(),\n  reader: oats.readers.https.json(\n    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oats-ts/oats-schemas/master/schemas/book-store.json',\n  ),\n  validator: oats.validator(),\n  generator: oats.generator({\n    nameProvider: oats.nameProviders.default(),\n    pathProvider: oats.pathProviders.default('src/generated'),\n    // Use presets.client() or presets.server() for just client/server side code\n    children: oats.presets.fullStack(),\n  }),\n  writer: oats.writers.typescript.file({\n    format: oats.formatters.prettier({\n      parser: 'typescript',\n    }),\n  }),\n})\n```\n\nEach part of this code can be customized or even fully replaced. The main components are:\n\n- `generate` - The main generator harness function\n- `reader` - Reads the input, resolves it's dependencies, and structuraly validates it\n- `validator` - Semantically validates the resolved document\n- `generator` - Runs a set of code generators, either as a list of individual generators, or presets\n- `writer` - Writes the generator output to the disk\n- `logger` - Event-driven logger that logs important generator events\n\n## Run Oats\n\nNow that we have the generator set up, you can run it like any node.js script:\n\n```text\nnode ./oats.js\n```\n\n**NOTE:** In this example we are using Javascript for configuring and running the generator, even though the project is built in and for Typescript. In case you want to define your configuration in Typescript, you can, but you'll need to solve running it, for which the simplest solution is [`ts-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node). However in a decent IDE (like VSCode) you will still have good content assist in Javascript, when putting together this configuration, because of the type definitions exposed by the Oats packages.\n\n## Verify results\n\nIn case Oats successfully ran, you will see something like this in the terminal:\n\n```text\n✔ reader step completed using \"@oats-ts/openapi-reader\"\n✔ validator step completed using \"@oats-ts/openapi-validator\"\n✔ generator step completed using \"@oats-ts/openapi-generators\"\ni some outputs have runtime dependencies:\n  npm i \\\n    @oats-ts/openapi-express-server-adapter@0.0.43 \\\n    @oats-ts/openapi-fetch-client-adapter@0.0.43 \\\n    @oats-ts/openapi-runtime@0.0.43 \\\n    express@^4.18.1\n✔ writer step completed using \"@oats-ts/typescript-writer\"\n```\n\nSome generated outputs might have runtime dependencies (eg.: you generated `express` routers, therefore the generated code has a runtime depdency on `express`). These dependencies are summarized as a convenient `npm install` command after the generator step completes (on line `5` in this example).\n\nGrab this command, and run it:\n\n```text\nnpm i \\\n  @oats-ts/openapi-express-server-adapter@0.0.43 \\\n  @oats-ts/openapi-fetch-client-adapter@0.0.43 \\\n  @oats-ts/openapi-runtime@0.0.43 \\\n  express@^4.18.1\n```\n\n## Using the generated code\n\nDepending on what you generated (`client`, `server` or `fullStack` - meaning both), check out these guides highlighting how to use the generator output for each:\n\n- [Using the generated SDK](OpenAPI_GeneratedSdk)\n- [Using the generated server](OpenAPI_GeneratedServer)\n"},78788:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>A});const A="# 🌱 oats\n\nThis project aims to provide a solution for generating quality Typescript code from API-describing documents. The only supported format currently is [OpenAPI 3.x](https://www.openapis.org), but there are plans to introduce generators for [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) as well.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the boilerplate a human developer has to write, to reduce the tedium around keeping a client and a server in sync, and to allow devs to focus on just displaying or moving data, without worrying about the structural correctness of that data.\n\n## why?\n\nWhy does this project exists? There are countless OpenAPI generators out there.\n\nThe main goals/differences are:\n\n- Make it work for 1 language (Typescript), and do that well.\n- Make every part of the API replaceable (without forking the project) in case it doesn't suit your needs.\n- Make it easy to customize, to suit a wide variety of use cases out of the box.\n- Make the generated code as easy to read, as if a dev would have written it by hand (or get as close to this as possible).\n\n## get started with OpenAPI\n\n- Check out the [docs](OpenAPI_Workflow) to get started!\n- The [demo](#/demo) page lets you experiment with oats, right here in the browser\n- If you find any issues, I'd greatly appreciate if you [report](https://github.com/oats-ts/oats-ts/issues) it!\n"},98184:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>A});const A="# Read\n\nThe reader step is responsible for\n\n- Reading your OpenAPI 3.x document\n- Parsing it\n- Structurally validating it\n- Resolving it's internal and external [references](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/using-ref)\n- And exposing it to the next step\n\nThe reader that comes with oats by default can be accessed from the [@oats-ts/openapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oats-ts/openapi), but it originates from the [@oats-ts/openapi-reader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oats-ts/openapi-reader) package.\n\n## Examples\n\n```ts\nimport { readers } from '@oats-ts/openapi'\n\n// Reads from the local file system, in json format\nconst jsonFileReader = readers.file.json('oa.json')\n\n// Reads from the local file system, in json format\nconst httpsYamlReader = readers.https.yaml('https://asd.com/oa.yaml')\n\n// Reads from any source in any format\nconst mixedReader = readers.mixed.mixed('http://localhost:3000/oa.json')\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Read\n\nThe reader can be configured to read inputs a few different ways:\n\n- `http` - Reads main input document (and all possible references) from http. Will fail if the main input (or any of the references) are not accessible through http (https, local file system etc).\n- `https` - Reads main input document (and all possible references) from https. Will fail if the main input (or any of the references) are not accessible through https (http, local file, etc).\n- `file` - Reads main input document (and all possible references) from your local file system. Will fail if the main input (or any of the references) are not on your file system.\n- `mixed` - Reads main input document (and all possible references) from any of the sources above. You can have for example a main document in your local file system, that can reference a document through http, which references another document through https.\n- `test` - Reads main input document (and all possible references) from memory. Ideal for testing custom generators end-to-end.\n\n### Parse\n\nFor parsing the document that has been read, there are also a few different built-in solutions:\n\n- `json` - Parses the document(s) using [JSON.parse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse).\n- `yaml` - Parses the document(s) using [yamljs](https://github.com/jeremyfa/yaml.js)\n- `mixed` - First tries to parse the document using `json`, then if that fails, it tries parsing using `yaml`. If both fail, the parsing is considered failed.\n\n## Advanced usage\n\nIn case the solutions above don't suit your needs, you can use the `readers.custom` function, to wich you need to provide a configuration object, with the following properties:\n\n- `path: string` - the entry point where the main document is\n- `sanitize: (path: string) => Try<string>` - Turns `path` into [fully qualified URI](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt)\n- `read: (uri: string) => Promise<Try<string>>` - Reads a document based on a fully qualified URI\n- `parse: (uri: string, input: string) => Promise<Try<OpenAPIObject>>` - Parses the result of a `read` into an `OpenAPIObject` (typings can be found in [@oats-ts/openapi-model](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oats-ts/openapi-model))\n"},68642:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>A});const A="# Error handling\n\nOats generated SDKs don't `throw` (or rather reject, as we are dealing with `Promise`s), unless the response is invalid according to the source OpenAPI document. Examples of rejections:\n\n- The `statusCode` doesn't match any of the statuses defined in the source OpenAPI document (eg.: it defines `200`, `400` and `500` but the response has a `403` status code).\n- The `mimeType` doesn't match any of the mime types defined for the given Operation and status code, defined in the source OpenAPI document (eg.: it defines `application/json` and `text/plain` but we get `application/xml`)\n- The response `body` doesn't validate against the schema described in the OpenAPI document\n\nIn all of these cases the server doesn't respect the same OpenAPI document we are working against, this is considered an unexpected situation, hence Oats throws.\n\nHowever, documented non `2xx` responses will not reject, the responses will be properly parsed, validated, etc, as according to the source OpenAPI document they are to be expected.\n\nThis gives you a flexible and easy to use way of error handling, that doesn't hide anything, but rather transparently reflects the servers described behaviour.\n\nA practical example:\n\n```typescript\nconst resp = await sdk.getBook({ path: { bookId: 42 } })\n// In case the statusCode is 200 (and you use a type guard like so)\nif (resp.statusCode === 200) {\n  // The body is known to be of Book type, and you can safely access fields on it:\n  console.log(resp.body.title)\n} else {\n  // Otherwise status is 400 or 500, for both of which the body is an array of AppErrors:\n  resp.body.forEach((err) => console.error(err.message))\n}\n```\n"},63380:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>A});const A="# Generate an SDK\n\nIn this guide you'll learn how to generate an SDK and (necessary related code) based on your OpenAPI document.

When you want to make a request:\n\n- You have to provide a strictly typed input parameter (`request`), with all the user input encapsulated.\n- And when you run it, you get a strictly typed response, with everything relevant from the response encapsulated.\n\n## Request types\n\nTODO description\n\n```typescript\nimport { GetBooksQueryParameters } from '../parameters/GetBooksQueryParameters'\nimport { GetBooksRequestHeaderParameters } from '../parameters/GetBooksRequestHeaderParameters'\n\nexport type GetBooksRequest = {\n  headers?: GetBooksRequestHeaderParameters\n  query?: GetBooksQueryParameters\n}\n```\n\n## Response types\n\nResponse types aim to encapsulate the responses defined in your source OpenAPI document without ambiguity. As an example, let's look at the response type used for the `getBooks` operation, called `GetBooksResponse`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { GetBooks200ResponseHeaderParameters } from '../parameters/GetBooks200ResponseHeaderParameters'\nimport { AppError } from '../types/AppError'\nimport { Book } from '../types/Book'\n\nexport type GetBooksResponse =\n  | {\n      statusCode: 200\n      mimeType: 'application/json'\n      body: Book[]\n      headers: GetBooks200ResponseHeaderParameters\n    }\n  | {\n      statusCode: 400\n      mimeType: 'application/json'\n      body: AppError[]\n    }\n  | {\n      statusCode: 500\n      mimeType: 'application/json'\n      body: AppError[]\n    }\n```\n\nIt is a union type of all the different responses, and they are discriminated by the `statusCode` and `mimeType` fields. This way, when you get a `GetBooksResponse`, checking the `statusCode` (and the `mimeType` in case you have multiple of those), `headers` and `body` types will not be a guesswork anymore.\n"},19132:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>A});const A="## SDK Usage\n\nTODO : The SDK implementation implements the above type as a `class` implementation. To actually start using it, you need to instantiate this class, with an input parameter called `adapter` of type `ClientAdapter`. This adapter is responsible for bridiging the generated code with a request library. Oats comes with a single client adapter based on the [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) API.

In this guide I'm going to store data in memory, but since all API methods return `Promise`s, you can use whatever data storage you choose.\n\n- First I'm adding an array with `Book` typed items, this is going to be our data storage (replace it with a database, another HTTP service, or whatever else you want)\n- I'm adding a hardcoded dummy item to this array, so it's not empty\n- Finally I'm implementing the `getBooks` method\n\n```typescript\nexport class BookStoreApiImpl implements BookStoreApi {\n  private readonly books: Book[] = [{ id: 1, author: 'Balázs', price: 10, title: 'test book' }]\n\n  async getBooks(request: GetBooksServerRequest): Promise<GetBooksResponse> {\n    return {\n      statusCode: 200,\n      mimeType: 'application/json',\n      body: this.books,\n      headers: {\n        'x-length': this.books.length,\n      },\n    }\n  }\n  async addBook(request: AddBookServerRequest): Promise<AddBookResponse> {\n    throw new Error('Method not implemented.')\n  }\n  async getBook(request: GetBookServerRequest): Promise<GetBookResponse> {\n    throw new Error('Method not implemented.')\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you do this along with the guide, you'll see that you have content assist and type checking for the response. The `statusCode` field is only allowed to be `200`, `400` and `500` (just as our source OpenAPI document defines this).

Start by creating a class, that implements `BookStoreApi`. A modern IDE (like VS Code) should be able to help you creating a stub for each method, and add the appropriate imports:\n\n```typescript\n// BookStoreApiImpl.ts\nimport { BookStoreApi } from './generated/api/BookStoreApi'\nimport { AddBookServerRequest } from './generated/requests/AddBookServerRequest'\nimport { GetBookServerRequest } from './generated/requests/GetBookServerRequest'\nimport { GetBooksServerRequest } from './generated/requests/GetBooksServerRequest'\nimport { AddBookResponse } from './generated/responses/AddBookResponse'\nimport { GetBookResponse } from './generated/responses/GetBookResponse'\nimport { GetBooksResponse } from './generated/responses/GetBooksResponse'\n\nexport class BookStoreApiImpl implements BookStoreApi {\n  async getBooks(request: GetBooksServerRequest): Promise<GetBooksResponse> {\n    throw new Error('Method not implemented.')\n  }\n  async addBook(request: AddBookServerRequest): Promise<AddBookResponse> {\n    throw new Error('Method not implemented.')\n  }\n  async getBook(request: GetBookServerRequest): Promise<GetBookResponse> {\n    throw new Error('Method not implemented.')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Create an express app\n\nNow that you have an API implementation that at least compiles, you can hook up the server using `express`. Let's create a file called `createBookStoreApp.ts`:\n\n```typescript\n// createBookStoreApp.ts\nimport express from 'express'\nimport { ExpressServerAdapter, jsonBodyParser } from '@oats-ts/openapi-express-server-adapter'\n\nimport { BookStoreApiImpl } from './BookStoreApiImpl'\nimport { createBookStoreAppRouter } from './generated/routers/createBookStoreAppRouter'\nimport { createBookStoreContextRouter } from './generated/routers/createBookStoreContextRouter'\n\nexport function createBookStoreApp() {\n  // Create an app, and add a body parser as usual\n  const app = express()\n  app.use(json())\n\n  // Add router/middleware, that exposes an instance of your API implementation,\n  // and an adapter connecting the generated code and the framework on response.locals.\n  createBookStoreContextRouter(app, new BookStoreApiImpl(), new ExpressServerAdapter())\n\n  // Add routers handling each operation. These routers will use the API implementation\n  // With the appropriate parameters, and use it's return value to construct a response.\n  createBookStoreAppRouter(app)\n\n  // Return the app\n  return app\n}\n```\n\n## Create a runnable file\n\nAnd in order to be able to test this, create a file called `index.ts`, where you create and start an instance of your app:\n\n```typescript\n// index.ts\nimport { createBookStoreApp } from './createBookStoreApp'\n\ncreateBookStoreApp().listen(5000)\n```\n\n## Make running this easy\n\nIn production I'd recommend compiling this first, but for now installing `ts-node`, and creating a simple `\"start\"` script in `package.json` will do:\n\n```json\n// package.json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"oats\": \"node ./oats.ts\",\n    \"start\": \"ts-node ./src/index.ts\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@oats-ts/openapi\": \"0.0.43\",\n    \"ts-node\": \"10.9.1\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Test if this works\n\nNow we have an easy to run server that should handle the appropriate requests, so let's test if it works:\n\n- Use `npm start` to start the server\n- Make a request to one of the endpoints, eg.: `GET http://localhost:5000/books` (I'd recommend using [Postman](https://www.postman.com), [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) or any other HTTP tester tool, to make your job easier)\n- You should get the standard express error response, with `500` as status, and the stack trace of our `throw new Error('Method not implemented.')` statement, originating from the appropraite method (in this case `getBooks`).\n"},97292:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>A});const A="## The API type\n\nThis is how the `BookStoreApi` type looks like (imports and JSDoc comments ommited):\n\n```typescript\nexport type BookStoreApi = {\n  getBooks(request: GetBooksServerRequest): Promise<GetBooksServerResponse>\n  addBook(request: AddBookServerRequest): Promise<AddBookServerResponse>\n  getBook(request: GetBookServerRequest): Promise<GetBookServerResponse>\n}\n```\n\nIf you have checked out the [SDK guide](OpenAPI_GeneratedSdk), it may look familiar and that is no accident.

Additionally we are going to write the generator's configuration in typescript as well, and to make it easy to run it, we are going to add `ts-node` to the project as well:\n\n```bash\nnpm i ts-node @oats-ts/oats-ts @oats-ts/openapi\n```\n\n### Generator configuration\n\nNext we need to put together the generator configuration, and we need to run this code.\n\nLet's assume, that your code lives in the `src` folder.

Responsible for coordinating the generator steps.\n  - `logger` - Logs the generator events as they happen. Can be either `simple` or `verbose`. If ommited, you will have no feedback about what's happening, so it's recommended to use a logger.\n  - `reader` - Reads the root OpenAPI document, resolving it's internal (and external) dependencies. Also structurally validates the document. Can read from `file`, `http` or `https` in `json` and `yaml` formats. For this example we are using a dummy OpenAPI document I use for testing, see more here: https://github.com/oats-ts/oats-schemas .\n  - `validator` - Takes the output of the reader, and validates it for any possible inconsistencies or issues that might trip up the generators.\n  - `generator` - Takes the output of the reader, and generates Typescript syntax tree from it. The work of the generator is split into smaller, single responsibilty code-generators, that are responsible for a single concern, eg.: generate schema types or parameter serializers.\n    - `nameProvider` - Function determining how each generated artifact should be named.\n    - `pathProvider` - Function determining what disk location each artifact should be written to.\n    - `children` - Either a list of single-responsible code-generators, or a preset, which is a collection of these generators. Individual generators are exposed in the `generators` object, coming from the `'@oats-ts/openapi'` package.\n  - `writer` - Takes the output of the generator, stringifies the syntax tree (SourceFiles), and then writes them to the disk.\n    - `format` - Function formatting the output before it gets written to the disk. In this case using the prettier formatter, and with the config the project is already using.\n\n## Run the code generator\n\nTo run it, you can either compile it and run it using the `node` command, or you can use `ts-node` to save the extra step (we are opting for this in this guide). You don't need any special runner.\n\n```bash\nts-node src/generate.ts\n```\n\nWhich will output something like:\n\n```bash\n✔ reader step completed using \"@oats-ts/openapi-reader\"\n✔ validator step completed using \"@oats-ts/openapi-validator\"\n✔ generator step completed using \"@oats-ts/openapi-generators\"\n✔ writer step completed using \"@oats-ts/typescript-writer\"\n```\n\nFor convenience, you could create an entry in your `package.json`, that runs this command, eg.:\n\n```jsonc\n{\n  \"name\": \"your-project\",\n  // ...\n  \"scripts\": {\n    // ...\n    \"oats\": \"ts-node src/generate.ts\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen you can just do this, for subsequent generator runs:\n\n```bash\nnpm run oats\n```\n\n## Where to go from here?\n\n- If you this looks interesting, check out the [demo](#/demo) page, where you can see the outputs of each generator, with either your OpenAPI inputs or samples!\n- If you find any issues, I'd greatly appreciate if you [report](https://github.com/oats-ts/oats-ts/issues) it!\n"},84287:(e,t,o)=>{"use strict";o.r(t),o.d(t,{default:()=>A});const A="# Write\n\nThe writer step is responsible for taking the output of the [generator step](OpenAPI-Generator) and writing it's outputs to the disk. The typescript writer takes typescript `SourceFile`s (this is Typescript's in-memory representation of an AST + file location) and writes them to the desired location.\n\nAdditionally it can add leading / trailing comments to each of your generated files. This is ideal for warning people that the file is generated and should be edited manually, or for disabling certain linter rules for the generated files.\n\n## Example\n\n### Basic usage\n\nBasic usage, formats the code using your project's prettier configuration. Formatter can be omitted, but the generated code won't be pretty in this case.\n\n```ts\nimport { writers, formatters } from '@oats-ts/openapi'\nimport prettierConfig from './.prettierrc.json'\n\nconst writer = writers.typescript.file({\n  format: formatters.prettier(prettierConfig),\n})\n```\n\n### With comments\n\nAdds comments. First leading comment warns about the fact that the file is generated, the second disables some `eslint` rules. The trailing comment re-enables these rules, so other code is not affected **(this is just an example, generated code will not break these specific rules)**.\n\n```ts\nimport { writers, formatters } from '@oats-ts/openapi'\nimport prettierConfig from './.prettierrc.json'\n\nconst writer = writers.typescript.file({\n  format: formatters.prettier(prettierConfig),\n  comments: {\n    leadingComments: [\n      {\n        type: 'block',\n        text: 'This is a generated file, please do not edit by hand!',\n      },\n      {\n        type: 'block',\n        text: 'eslint-disable no-console, no-alert',\n      },\n    ],\n    trailingComments: [\n      {\n        type: 'block',\n        text: 'eslint-enable no-console, no-alert',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe `writers.typescript` object exposes 3 factory functions:\n\n- `file` - Writes the generated code to the disk. Configuration:\n  - `comments: CommentsConfig` - Adds leading / trailing comments to each generated file.\n  - `format(code: string): string` - Formats the code, before writing to the disk. Default formatter shipping with oats is `formatters.prettier()`.\n- `memory` - Doesn't write the output to the disk, returns the generated code instead as `{ path: string; content: string }[]` instead. Configuration:\n  - `comments: CommentsConfig` - Adds leading / trailing comments to each generated file.\n  - `format(code: string): string` - Formats the code, before writing to the disk. Default formatter shipping with oats is `formatters.prettier()`.\n- `custom` - Customizeable `write` function, ideal if you want to send the output over the wire for example. Configuration:\n  - `comments: CommentsConfig` - Adds leading / trailing comments to each generated file.\n  - `format(code: string): string` - Formats the code, before writing to the disk. Default formatter shipping with oats is `formatters.prettier()`.\n  - `write(path: string, content: string): Promise<void>` - Writes the stringified, possibly formatted `content` to the disk at `path`.\n"},38957:function(e,t,o){"use strict";var A=this&&this.__importDefault||function(e){return e&&e.__esModule?e:{default:e}};Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0}),t.App=void 0,o(38419);const r=A(o(67294)),n=o(18592),a=o(49818),i=o(68835),s=o(87640),l=o(32869),c=o(2968),d=o(35194),u=o(89019);t.App=()=>{const e=(0,d.useColorModeContext)();return r.default.createElement(c.ColorModeContext.Provider,{value:e},r.default.createElement("div",{className:(t=e.colorMode,n.css`
